<h2>
	<p> My name is Rashad. I have 10+ years in management consulting. I recently left Citigroup to pursue Independent Consulting. I was interested in Rampup to learn the basics of web development and coding. I thought rampup would be a good way to learn since it provides some structure as opposed to learn on your own. </p>
